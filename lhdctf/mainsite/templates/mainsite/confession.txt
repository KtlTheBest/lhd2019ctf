I'm tired of this job. The tasks are always repetitive. I never wanted this. When I first started doing it, I thought that I will be able to create something that will be use of to someone. However, I was mistaken. I feel like deadlines are crushing me. Everything seems to hold on some shitcode and adhocs. You can't touch the code, or everything will crush. And you don't have time to refactor it. The system needs to be online during the day. Argh. So tired. It is not what I wanted...
